Project description: Depiction of a nightmare in which the protagonist is running from a bunch of slime balls. The slime balls collide with each other. I found my background and my running man on OpenGameArt. I coded the slime physics from scratch. I also made changes to the framework such that all objects are managed by an ObjectManager singleton class instead of the Engine.

The easiest part of this project: Making changes to the code that were specified in the project instructions.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Getting my video to run smoothly
